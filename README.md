## Spaced Out

Spaced Out is a productivity mobile app that encourages users to perform real life tasks. A user can set a task and schedule when they wish to complete it. Once the task has been finished they are rewarded with XP which the user can spend on their astronaut character on the game page. The more tasks the user completes the more upgrades their character can get. As the character becomes more powerful the user can win more battles, each victory gives the user a resource called gold. They can spend this resource on the shop page where there are several cosmetic items to choose from to make the game and their character look better. The user can equip these items on the equip page. This was a college project, we were able to complete this in a single semester ending in late April.
